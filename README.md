We are creating a page that can search the boardgamegeek website via their api to find rankings and other information about a game.
The page may have the top 10 games so that most users can see those

YouTube videos applicable to the game will also appear (5?)
Possible subreddit thread if searching for a specific pain point with a game

## User Story:

As someone interested in board games
I want to find out about a board game
So that I can determine if I want to purchase it and/or play it
Acceptance Criteria
Given a board game search dashboard
When I search for a game (or maybe an issue with a game)
Then I am presented with information from boardgame geek and youtube (reddit)
When I view the page there will be a top games list on the page in-case that is what they are searching for
Then When I search they disappear 
When they do not know of a specific game they can search by genre
Then the top 10 in that genre will show up as well as some related videos

## APIâ€™s to be Used:
* Boardgamegeek
