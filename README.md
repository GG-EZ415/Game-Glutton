YouTube videos applicable to the game will also appear (5?)
Possible subreddit thread if searching for a specific pain point with a game

## User Story:

As someone interested in board games
I want to find out about a board game
So that I can determine if I want to purchase it and/or play it
Acceptance Criteria
Given a board game search dashboard
When I search for a game (or maybe an issue with a game)
Then I am presented with information from boardgame geek and youtube (reddit)
When I view the page there will be a top games list on the page in-case that is what they are searching for
Then When I search they disappear 
When they do not know of a specific game they can search by genre
Then the top 10 in that genre will show up as well as some related videos
